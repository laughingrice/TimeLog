# TimeLog - Time keeper app

Small PyQt5 tray App to keep track of time spent on different client/project tasks
Stores time logs in a csv file in ~/.local/share/TimeLog (configurable via config file)

Tested on OsX, should work the same on linux, probably Windows, although storage path may need to be reconfigured.
